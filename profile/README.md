# Virtual Brain Lab

The [Virtual Brain Lab](https://virtualbrainlab.org) builds intuitive and interactive 3D visualizations for neuroscience.

The VBL is located within the [Steinmetz Lab](http://www.steinmetzlab.net/) at the University of Washington and many of our projects are collaborations with the [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/).

Please see the individual projects for installation instructions and documentation!
